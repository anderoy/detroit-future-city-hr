            <h4>Transformative ideas: neighborhoods</h4>

            <section id="1">
                <h5><a name="1"></a>1. A city that shares vision: coordinating the management of vacant land</h5>

                <p>Public land and facility strategies must be aligned with the City’s strategies for neighborhood revitalization, economic growth, and creation of blue/green infrastructure, while the activities of each of the public landholding entities as well as other public agencies must be grounded in a single coordinated strategic framework.</p>

                <p>We need to begin thinking of properties in public ownership and those in private ownership as part of a single system. <strong>All land, whatever its legal ownership, is public in the sense that how it is used and maintained affects its neighbors and the community as a whole, and affects the city’s ability to preserve its neighborhoods and build its economy.</strong> More important than who actually owns the inventory is how it fits into the vision for the city. Detroit needs to develop a coordinated system in which all entities operate consistently across all aspects of public land management and private land regulation, making decisions based on clear policy goals and principles, and utilizing available legal and financial tools as efficiently as possible. Wherever title to any single parcel resides, that parcel should be seen as being part of single inventory, guided by a single set of policies and goals.</p>

                <p>Such a profound change in thinking and procedures will not be easy. The transformation of Detroit’s approach to its land will require many separate agencies, with separate missions and priorities, to subordinate their differences to a common direction and purpose, and to foster unprecedented connections among landholding, regulatory, and user agencies. In the long run, public landholding agencies and those leading the city’s regeneration should explore realignment of responsibilities, including reducing the number of separate entities holding title to public parcels, to increase the system’s efficiency and take better advantage of the legal and technical capacities of particular agencies.</p>


            </section>


            <section id="2">
                <h5><a name="2"></a>2. A city where everything is connected: viewing vacant and problem properties within one interrelated system</h5>

                <p>Detroit contains an estimated 150,000 vacant properties, roughly 2/3 vacant land parcels and the rest vacant buildings. Of these, the eight public landholding entities control about 66,000, or well under half. In addition, the city contains an unknown number of problem properties that are still occupied, including underutilized, poorly maintained industrial buildings and many absentee-owned houses and small apartment buildings suffering from neglect.</p>

                <p>Historically, the respective systems designed to deal with publicly owned and privately owned properties have not been integrated. The latter is managed as a regulatory function, and has regrettably suffered from the lack of resources that burdens many of Detroit’s systems. Many ordinances are on the books, but are poorly or intermittently enforced, with too few personnel to keep up with the volume of properties.</p>

                <p><strong>Decisions about vacant land and problem properties, whether in public or private ownership, need to be made through a single lens:</strong> How will these properties be treated, so their outcomes will benefit the city by stabilizing neighborhoods, fostering economic growth, and creating opportunities for new infrastructure and innovation, rather than continue to act as a drag on the city’s future?</p>

            </section>


            <section id="3">
                <h5><a name="3"></a>3. A city of strategic approaches: recognizing the uniqueness of each property's value and challenges</h5>

                <p>A coordinated approach to addressing Detroit’s vacant land must begin with a strategic approach to addressing the land in public ownership to maximize the city’s ability to create long-term value and enhance community amenities and quality of life through its use and reuse. <strong>This approach must be grounded in
                a basic principle: Vacant land is not fungible—each property has its own problems, and its own potentials.</strong> Every decision a public agency makes about land has strategic implications; this applies to the following areas:</p>

                <ul>

                 Property acquisition, including establishing policies about which properties should be added to the public inventory;

                 Property disposition, including determining the most appropriate reuse, identifying suitable buyers, and selecting the most appropriate disposition methods;

                 Property holding strategies, including when properties should be held for long-term public purposes, for assembly into more buildable or marketable sites, or for future reuse potential;

                 Maintenance of public land; and

                 Demolition of vacant structures

                </ul>

                <p>All decisions about public land, from acquisition to disposition, should be made on the basis of strategic principles designed to lead to the best results for the city from that decision.</p>

            </section>


            <section id="4">
                <h5><a name="4"></a>4. A new urban landscape: using land for infrastructure and innovation</h5>

                <p>Many people in Detroit, as elsewhere, still think of reuse of vacant land as equivalent to redevelopment of new buildings to replace the ones that have been torn down. Yet the reality is that, outside certain key locations, continuing demographic and economic trends mean that little new development will take place in Detroit for many years. <strong>This is a challenge, but also a great opportunity. It means that Detroit’s vast inventory of vacant land can be used for a variety of new purposes, to foster innovations in public open space, urban agriculture, clean energy, and more; and to build a new network of blue/green infrastructure to divert stormwater from the city’s overtaxed sewer system and clean the city’s air.</strong></p>

                <p>Pursuing this idea also demands a change in attitude toward the large areas of vacant land that cover many parts of the city. Rather than seeing this land as largely worthless, and being eager to unload it to any willing private party, the public sector should see this land as being of value, and of creating large, contiguous tracts where current holdings may be substantial but fragmented. This, in turn, calls for greater emphasis on holding rather than selling public land, and on making it more costly for private entities—often speculators—to hold onto vacant parcels instead of using them productively or relinquishing them.</p>

                <p>It also requires us to think about the smaller lots in traditional neighborhoods not as necessarily future infill sites, but as long-term open spaces in those neighborhoods, and to ensure that they are used in ways that strengthen, rather than undermine, the fabric of those areas.</p>

                <p>Finally, it calls for an open-minded, creative approach to innovation and experimentation. The sheer scale of the vacant land available creates the opportunity to try out different reuse alternatives, some of which may be new and largely untried. Both through its land use regulations and its disposition policies, the City should encourage the full range of ideas for reuse of vacant land in ways that hold promise to further the city’s revitalization and enhance its quality of life.</p>

                <h5><a name="5"></a>5. A city where public facility investments count: aligning public facilities investments with land use transformation</h5>

                <p>Much of the public land inventory in Detroit is made up of public facilities,
                including public schools, parks, recreation facilities and community centers,
                police substations, and more. Those facilities are an important part of the ‘glue’
                holding the city’s neighborhoods together, and defining the quality of life in those
                neighborhoods. Today, as a result of declining population and financial resources,
                many of those facilities, particularly school buildings, have been closed, and many  others, including many of the city’s parks, fall short of their promise. Population and
                fiscal constraints are realities that cannot be wished away, but a different approach can be taken within those constraints to integrate decisions about public facilities into larger decisions about Detroit’s future land use.</p>

                <p>Decisions about public facilities are being made in Detroit every year—whether to close a facility or invest money in upgrading it, whether to close a park or reduce its ongoing maintenance, where to consolidate public facilities and services, how to reuse vacant facilities, and more. Each of these decisions affects far more than the facility itself. <strong>Going forward, all such decisions should be aligned with the larger strategies governing the future of the neighborhoods and other areas in which they are located, so that their outcomes enhance the stability of neighborhoods slated for revitalization, or help further the conversion of others areas into blue/green infrastructure or other non-development reuses.</strong></p>
