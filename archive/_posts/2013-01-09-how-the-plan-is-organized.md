	<h1>Guide To The Strategic Framework</h1>
	<h2>how it is used</h2>
</hgroup>

<p>The Detroit Strategic Framework establishes a set of policy directions and actions designed to achieve a more desirable and sustainable Detroit in the near term and for future generations. The Strategic Framework is organized into Five Planning Elements and a civic engagement chapter. These Five Elements include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Economic Growth Element: The Equitable City</li>
	<li>The Land Use Element: The Image of the City</li>
	<li>The City Systems and Environment Element: The Sustainable City</li>
	<li>The Neighborhoods Element: The City of Distinct and Regionally Competitive Neighborhoods</li>
	<li>The Land and Buildings Assets Element: A Strategic Approach to Public Land</li>
</ul>

<p>These Elements outline a detailed approach to addressing the realities and
imperatives that will enable Detroit to move toward a more prosperous future.</p>

<p><strong>pragmatic, adaptable blueprint.</strong> The Framework represents the specifics of a vision that can remain flexible and be refined and enriched over time. It is not a master plan, but a shared framework that guides decision making among individuals, institutions, businesses, organizations, and neighborhoods toward a future city, which is culturally rich and offers opportunities for all of Detroit’s residents, institutions, businesses, and neighborhoods.</p>

<p>The Strategic Framework is an inclusive shared vision that uses engagement to look beyond the city’s historic barriers of geography, race, and economic differences. Equally important, it focuses on the assets of all areas to illustrate that all communities can be unique and be a part of the bigger image of Detroit, where a variety of neighborhood types is encouraged.</p>

<p><strong>WHat tHe strategic frameWorK is and isn’t.</strong> As the Detroit Works process went forward, many people asked, “How is this plan different from any other?” and “How will it improve the quality of life in my community or for my business?” The answer is that, while the Strategic Framework addresses issues and presents recommendations in a similar format to other planning documents, it also is not intended to be a conventional “Vision Plan.” That type of plan is usually highly aspirational and often presents static illustrative projection for what the future of a region, city, or community will look like, with little detail on how to achieve the vision.</p>

<p>The Strategic Framework is also not the Master Plan of Policies, the legally mandated, long-range document of land development policies that support the social, economic, and physical development and conservation of the city, proposed by the Mayor and approved by the city council in 2009. There are specific statutory procedures and formats required for that type of document, and it is typically executed by the municipality’s planning agency.</p>

<p>The aim of the Strategic Framework is to recognize and adapt to an unpredictable future. The Strategic Framework is designed for flexibility and choices that will enable different sectors in Detroit to act both collaboratively and independently, and over different periods of time, but in a coordinated way. As a comprehensive and action-oriented blueprint for near- and long-range decision-making, the Strategic Framework Plan is 1) aspirational toward a physical and social vision for the city; and 2) actionable, with strategies for new policies and implementation; and 3) accountable, with assignment of implementation responsibilities.</p>

<p><strong>WHo tHe frameWorK is for, and WHo sHould maKe it Happen.</strong> The Detroit Strategic Framework is one shared vision designed to guide the decisions of a wide range of implementers, investors, and regulators participating in the revitalization of Detroit. Every sector of Detroit will play an important and critical role in executing the vision, both independently and in collaboration with one another. Each sector can use the plan to guide its own decisions about investments, localize planning, align with public funding programs, conduct or encourage interim and permanent development, inform decisions about buying and selling land and businesses, and create partnerships across sectors.</p>

<p><strong>Horizons for cHange.</strong> Just as the Strategic Framework is intended to offer recommendations and approaches that can adapt to changing realities in Detroit, so also the 10-, 20-, and 50-year Horizons adopted for the Framework are intended not as literal forecasts, but as aspirational possibilities and an aid to imagining the city’s changes. These Horizons also offer three useful ways to look at progress and change in Detroit: Stabilization, Improvement, and Sustainability.</p>

<h3>ThE ECOnOMIC GROWTh ElEMEnT</h3>

<p>The Economic Growth Element proposes five strategies to grow Detroit’s economy in a way that is equitable for all Detroiters, supports Detroit’s economic sectors, and can attract new residents and businesses:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Support the Four Key Economic Growth Pillars that have already demonstrated promising job growth: education and medical employment (“Eds and Meds”), digital and creative jobs, industrial employment (both traditional and new technologies, large-scale and artisanal, manufacture, and processes), and local entrepreneurship.</li>
	<li>Use place-based strategies to create core investment and employment corridors, focusing on seven employment districts where job growth is already occurring.</li>
	<li>Encourage local entrepreneurship and minority-owned business.</li>
	<li>Improve education and skills development.</li>
	<li>Transform the city’s land into an economic asset.</li>
</ul>

<h3>ThE lAnD uSE ElEMEnT</h3>

<p>The Land Use Element offers land use strategies that are situated between the city’s existing conditions and a range of preferred futures. The Detroit Strategic Framework organizes a wide variety of potential land use types within three levels of scale and purpose:</p>

<ul>
	<li>FRAMEWORK ZONES that guide citywide and investment decisions in terms of the best ways to make positive change in areas with a range of physical and market characteristics. The most influential characteristic is vacancy, because of its drastic effect on physical and market conditions of an area.</li>
	<li>LAND USE TYPOLOGIES that provide the future vision for land use within the city. They are divided into three primary categories: neighborhood, industrial, and landscape.</li>
	<li>DEVELOPMENT TYPES that visualize how
the physical development of buildings and landscape may occur within a particular land use typology. They are divided into four major categories: residential, commercial, landscape, and industrial.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the Detroit Strategic Framework recommends the following supportive strategies for land use:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Create a new and diverse open space system for the city,</li>
	<li>Redefine corridors and complete streets, and</li>
	<li>Develop innovative regulatory reform.</li>
</ul>

<h3>ThE CITy SySTEMS ElEMEnT</h3>

<p>This Element describes the imperative of moving toward a more affordable, efficient, and environmentally sustainable city through reforms to how services are delivered throughout the city, and through transformation of the systems and networks that carry the city’s water, waste, energy, and transportation. This chapter proposes six strategies:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reform system delivery to adapt to the current population and to better coordinate public and private service provision for more efficient and reliable services that will adapt to future needs.</li>
<li>Create innovative landscapes (green and blue infrastructure) that actively clean the air and water to provide better environmental quality and public health for Detroit.</li>
<li>Reshape transportation to establish Detroit within a regional, multimodal network that better serves commercial and personal transportation needs, especially in terms of connecting neighborhoods and employment districts, as well as better serving Detroit’s freight industry.</li>
<li>Improve lighting efficiency throughout the city.</li>
<li>Enhance communications access in Detroit.</li>
<li>Actively manage change, by continuing discussions that have already begun removing regulatory barriers, to interagency cooperation at the city and regional levels, as well as establishing an interagency platform for coordinated decision making about city services.</li>
